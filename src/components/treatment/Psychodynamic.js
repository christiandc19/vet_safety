                        <h1>Psychodynamic Therapy</h1>
                        <p>Psychodynamic therapy is a talking therapy. This means that it is based on the concept that talking about problems can help people learn and develop the skills they need to address them. <br /><br />

                        It is an approach that embraces the multifaceted aspects of an individual’s life. It strives to help people understand the sometimes unknown or unconscious motivations behind difficult feelings and behaviors.<br /><br />

                        Having this insight can lead to symptom relief, help people feel better, and allow them to make better choices.</p>
